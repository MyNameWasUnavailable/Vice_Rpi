# Vice_Rpi

This is an installation script to install Vice Commodore 64 emulator on a raspberry pi.

This script is not enitrely of my own work, and is reliant on the work of other projects, namely these below:

https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup
https://github.com/gilyes/pi-shutdown

to install:
	- Flash a fresh copy of Raspbian lite (tested on stretch only) to your sd card
	- Ensure your internet connectivity is working
	- git clone https://github.com/MyNameWasUnavailable/Vice_Rpi.git
	- cd vice_rpi
	- sudo chmod +x retro_pi_vice.sh
	- sudo ./retro_pi_vice.sh
