# Vice_Rpi

******* WARNING - Work in progress, not currently fully functional!  Use at own risk!********


This is an installation script to install Vice Commodore 64 emulator on a raspberry pi.

This script is not enitrely of my own work, and is reliant on the work of other projects, namely these below:

https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup

https://github.com/gilyes/pi-shutdown

to install:

	- Flash a fresh copy of Raspbian lite (tested on stretch only) to your sd card
	
	- Ensure your internet connectivity is working
	
	- git clone https://github.com/MyNameWasUnavailable/Vice_Rpi.git
	
	- cd Vice_Rpi
	
	- sudo chmod +x retro_pi_vice.sh
	
	- sudo ./retro_pi_vice.sh
	
On a pi zero w this took over an hour to compile and install vice, have not as yet tested on a pi3
